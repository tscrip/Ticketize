# Ticketize
Basic work order system... Materialize, Prioritize, Ticketize

This is a project was created to show how different languages/frameworks all do the exact same tasks. Ticketize allows new coders to see how different these technologies work, and it allows them to decide which language/framework they prefer.

For consistency sake, there are a few things that are exactly the same across all of these projects.
### Backend ###
* Database: MySQL X.XX
  
### Frontend ###
* CSS: Twitter Bootstrap X.XX
* Icons: Font Awesome X.XX
