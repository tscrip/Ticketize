# Ticketize #
Basic work order system... Materialize, Prioritize, Ticketize

This is a project was created to show how different languages/frameworks all do the exact same tasks. Ticketize allows new coders to see how different these technologies work, and it allows them to decide which language/framework they prefer.

For consistency sake, there are a few things that are exactly the same across all of these projects.
### Backend Standards ###
* Database: MySQL X.XX (ASP.NET projects will use MSSQL Server)
  
### Frontend Standards ###
* CSS: Twitter Bootstrap X.XX
* Icons: Font Awesome X.XX

This project is broken into 3 sections: **Frontend**, **Backend-API**, and **Backend-SSR**.

### Frontend ###
Frontend is the GUI(Graphical User Interface) that the user will see when they visit the site. All of the projects in the **Frontend** folder contain all of the required HTML(Markup), CSS(Style), and Javascript(Client Side Scripting) that is required for the site to function. I have choosen to build GUIs with what I think are the 11 **MOST** popular client side frameworks. Below are these frameworks presented alphabetically:
```
AngularJS: 1.6.4
Angular: 4.1.3
Aurelia:  1.1.4
Backbone: 1.3.3
Ember: 2.14
jQuery: 3.2.1
Knockout: 3.4.2
Polymer: 2.0.0
React: 15.6.1
Svelte: 1.25.1
Vue.js: 2.4.2
```
### Backend-API ###
Backend API is the server side code that generates the data for our frontend. In addition to multiple different languages, I have also decided to cover many different frameworks in each language. Below are what I feel at the **MOST** popular frameworks in the **7 MOST** popular backend programming languages. Below are the languages and frameworks sorted alphabetically:
```
**C#**
ASP.Net
ASP.Net Core

**Go**
Martini
Gorilla
Echo

**Java**
Spring
Spark
Struts
Grails

**Node.js**
