## Notes ##
As this is my preferred framework, there is not a whole lot to say. I like it for it ease of use, versitility, and lightweight nature. The only thing that tends to get tricky is Database Connectivity. 

In this example, I use Knex and Treeize to extract data. You could probably use Sequilize, Bookshelf, or ORM2, but from my experience, these do not work very well. They are either not documentent very well, or due to Node's AYSC nature, are VERY hard to implement. That is why I have opted for Knex.

## Grading ##
Here is my oppinion on grading:

### Learning Curve: 4 ###
Node is EVERYWHERE. On top of this, Express is THE web framework. You will be able to find tons of tutorials to guide you through the process of configuring Express.

### Popularity: 9 (33,000 Stars) ###
Being Node's most popular framework, most projects you find out there are using Express, or are looking to move to Express. I think it is a pretty decent framework to build your project upon as evident by the fact that it is now part of the NodeJS Foundation.

Community (1-10) - Based on Combination of StackOverflow post and GitHub Issues
Versitility (1-10) - Based on how rigid the framework is
Lines Of Code (1-10) - How many lines of code were required to build the solution
